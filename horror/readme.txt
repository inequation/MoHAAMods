File            : Survival Horror
Author          : IneQuation a.k.a. Rookie One
Version         : 0.7 Halloween Edition
Release Date    : 01.11.2006

Description     :
A group of survivors is being terrorized by a phantom murderer. Stealth and armed with a deadly weapon, he can sneak down upon you unnoticed and kill you. Will the survivors manage to prevail? Or will the murderer rather eliminate them all? Let the horror begin!

One of the player is chosen (the one who played the murderer the least times) to be the murderer and given a silenced pistol with unlimited ammo and increased bullet damage. He can neither use any other weapon nor drop his pistol for any other player to use. He's invisible, but he appears for a fraction of second at the moment he shoots or touches another player, glowing red. The others, when seeing or hearing the murderer, shoot blindly around, praying for their bullets to hit the murderer. ;)

There are some effects to provide a good atmosphere - night, storm with lightnings, "suspicious" music and disturbing sounds (squeaks, footsteps etc.).

Big thanks to Elgan and JoeyC for hosting the mod on their servers, and to Art and At0mic for testing! :)

You can shut the mod down via the nohorror cvar (nohorror 1; works after a restart). Use the horror_timelimit cvar to set the murderer's turn length in seconds.

Known bugs      :
There is a 10-seconds delay at the beginning of the round. Somehow it's necessary for the mod to work. Don't ask me why, no idea. Also, the murderer selection process sometimes occurs a couple of times before it actually performs the selection. Just be patient and ignore it, it will work. ;)

Installation    :
Put the zzzuser-Rookie_One-Survival_Horror-v0.7.pk3 file into your MoHAA/main directory. The mod needs the Team Match gametype - g_gametype 2. Will run on any map. I suggest you to turn friendly fire on (g_teamdamage 1) for more confusion and havoc. :P
